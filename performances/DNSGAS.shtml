<p>Sure.  For all of you faithful, adoring fans the release of our newest CD, <span class="worktitle">Anti-Social Music Sings the Great American Songbook</span>, is intensely exciting.  But we're pretty much sick of it by now.  That's why Anti-Social Music Does NOT Sing the Great American Songbook on Saturday, Dec. 10th at Chashama.</p>
<p>Oh sure, we'll be &quot;singing&quot; a few choice numbers from the album, but for our own sanity we'll also be featuring several tunes which are fairly new and that you may not have even heard before.</p>
<p>But enough of that, here's something we can all get excited about:  <strong>BEER</strong>!  That's right, the Dec. 10th concert isn't just a CD Release Party, it's a CD Release Kegger!  Not only that, but <strong>The Hold Steady</strong> will be there to play a few songs.  Holy crap!  For a mere $14.99, you'll get admission to the show (including The Hold Steady and some other special guest performances), a copy of our brand-new CD, and a cup to do with as you please.</p>
<p>You'll be drunk, we'll be drunk, and a fun time will be had by all.</p>
<p>And, of course, thanks again to NYSCA and JPMorgan for their financial support!</p>

<p>
Anti-Social Music Does NOT Sing the Great American Songbook<br/>
+The Hold Steady and other Special Guests<br/>
Saturday, Dec. 10th 8 PM<br/>
At Chashama<br/>
217 E 42nd St. (bet. 2nd and 3rd Aves)

<p>Love, <br/>ASM</p>
