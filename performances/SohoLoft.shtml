<h3>ASM drinks alone in a Soho loft</h3>
			</div>

			<div id="details">

<p>
	You know those stories about legendary shows that happened in some nameless place in some really hip part of Manhattan 30 years ago? You wonder how anyone knew to go to that place, at that time, to see history being made.
</p>

<p>
	The reality is that no one did. They just happened to do it. They went out, on a Tuesday, or a Thursday, in the waning days of Spring, ignoring the fact that there are TV shows to watch, or an early day the next morning, or it's a part of town they always get lost in. They go to back alleys and knock on doors in the that way their cool friends told them too. 
</p>

<p>
	And they don't ever regret it. You know why?
</p>

<p>
	Because this is what Life is. Doing things that could be a crazy mistake, or a brilliant accident. Taking chances. Seizing opportunities. These people seek out experiences that they know nothing about in advance. They approach art with unformed opinions. They try new food. They probably drink "too much." They live life full of vivid colors, enticing smells, and fierce visuals. You too can be one of these people. You need to break out of your routine. Every day is yesterday's tomorrow; don't waste tomorrow's yesterday doing what you did the day before. SET YOURSELF FREE.
</p>

<p>
	Or, decades from now, you can tell your friends about that night you stayed home and watched The Big Bang Theory, or The Astronaut Wives Club. (Three letters: D V R)
