Mare Crisium: Sea Of Crisis
</p>

<p>
Formed by ancient volcanic activity, Mare Crisium is viewed by those on Earth as one of the moon’s “seas” but is in reality a basaltic plain. It is immortalized in literature as the site of Arthur C. Clarke’s short story “The Sentinel,” considered to be one of the seeds for his later work with Stanley Kubrick, ”2001- A Space Odyssey” as well as being told in song by Roger McGuinn and The Byrds on the album “The Notorious Byrd Brothers.”
</p>

<p>
To many observers, the United States, even the entire globe, is immersed in a sea of crises of our own making. Can these be resolved without total apocalypse? There are utopian visionaries and dire doomsayers with strong opinions on either side. This musical composition “Mare Crisium” for six electric guitarists offers a non-linear, non-rational coded sonic response to the situation and hopes to provide psychoacoustic chemical change to the players and listeners.
</p>

<p>
Sharp's compositional strategies in <span class="worktitle">Mare Crisium</span> include shifting dronalities, algorithmic instruction sets, graphic notation, overtone melodies, and difference tone effects.
</p>

<p>
The performers include Sally Gates, Kevin Ramsay, Angela Babin, Gian Perez, Matteo Liberatore, and Sharp.
