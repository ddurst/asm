<h3>New Music from Ukraine</h3>

			</div>

			<div id="details">

<p>
After Anti-Social Music's late 2010 tour of Ukraine, we brought back many souvenirs: empty vodka bottles, 
empty liqueur bottles, empty beer bottles, photos of Pat looking majestically into the middle distance 
next to a stuffed tiger, empty honey pepper vodka bottles, and don't even get us started on the FULL 
bottles.  But the best souvenirs of all had to be shipped separately and are only just arriving &ndash; <b>composer 
Alla Zagaykevych</b> and <b>composer/violinist Roman Ros</b>.
</p>

<p>
They helped us get our music heard and even joined in on a few tunes so it's past time for us to repay them.  
We're flying them here and they'll be performing with us on Tuesday, February 7th at 7:30 PM in the Ukrainian 
Institute of New York City.  We'll play with and premiere pieces by both Alla and Roman in addition to new pieces 
by Pat Muchmore and our beloved Andrea La Rose who sent us the work from her new home in Germany.  Kyiv, New York 
City, Ivano-Frankivsk and Erlangen; it's four cities and three countries for the price of one-and-a-half beers.  
Come out and knock back a few &#1087;&#1080;&#1074;&#1086; and help us bid them a fond 
&#1076;&#1086;&#1073;&#1088;&#1080;&#1081;&nbsp;&#1074;&#1077;&#1095;&#1110;&#1088;.  If you're lucky we'll even 
whip out our comprehensive 200+ photo slide show of us drinking in numerous unrecognizable Ukrainian settings!
