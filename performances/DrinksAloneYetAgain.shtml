<h3>ASM Drinks Alone Yet Again<br/>(+ Charles Waters PEACE FORMS)</h3>
			</div>
	
			<div id="details">

<p>Timon, the misanthrope of Athens, upon a friend telling him as they were drinking together, "What a pleasant party, Timon!" replied, "It would be, if you were away." His epitaph reportedly read "Timon, the misanthrope, am I below/Go, and revile me, traveller, only go."</p>

<p>Cicero quoted Publius Cornelius Scipio as remarking that he was "never less lonely than when he was by himself." Cicero himself said "I shun the sight of scoundrels who swarm on every side. I withdraw as completely as I can; and I am often alone."</p>

<p>It is in fine classical tradition, then, that Anti-Social Music announces the latest in our series of solo premieres "Anti-Social Music Drinks Alone." After which we will retreat &ndash; leaving singly, at intervals of no less than sixty seconds, to avoid overtaking each otherâ€”to an Edward Hopper painting.</p>

<p>ASM performs a set of solo pieces written by Patrick Castillo, Ty Citerman, Max Duykers, Andrea La Rose, Pat Muchmore, Ed RosenBerg and Charlie Waters. Performers include Ty Citerman (guitar), Domenica Fossati (flute), Steven Gosling (piano), Mihai Marica (cello), Pat Muchmore (cello), and Ed RosenBerg (reeds).</p>

<p class="smallprint">This program is supported, in part, by public funds from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs, in partnership with the City Council, and in part with public funds from the New York State Council on the Arts, a state agency. Which is basically to say &ndash; your tax dollars at work. Yeah, frightening isn't it?</p>
