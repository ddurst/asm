<p>New York, NY November 13, 2003 -- After weeks of taunts and challenges, Anti-Social Music officially announced their decision to enter into a contract with Frank Oteri's "21st Century Schizoid Music" (21SM) new-music series. A match-up with Guignol is scheduled in Cornelia Street Cafe for Monday, November 24. This confirms Anti-Social Music's recent ringside declaration at K-1's "21st Century Schizoid Music" where he directly challenged 21SM superstar Guignol.</p>
<p>The contract, which comes after weeks of discussion and speculation, sanctions Anti-Social Music to fight exclusively with 21SM in Japan. Rumors of a possible Anti-Social Music/Guignol match-up have circulated with Guignol's proclamations on national television and radio that the path would be cleared for them to take on the former champion under the K-1 banner.</p>
<p>"I'll do it right here, get me a pair of shorts and I'll fight them tonight," shouted Anti-Social Music from the August 15th Las Vegas event which was broadcast on ESPN Pay-Per-View. "Sign the contract...sign the contract!" Guignol replied, "We'll do it, I'll fight Anti-Social Music with all my heart, spirit and technique. We'll sign the contract to fight you today. The Beast is coming for you!"</p>
<p>"The entire K-1 team was thrilled following Anti-Social Music's stunning challenge and looks forward to the December match-up," said Frank Oteri, K-1 USA President. "Their signing brings the skill and notoriety of new music's biggest star to K-1 fans in both Japan and worldwide."</p>

ABOUT GUIGNOL<br/>
The raucous, theatrical, spastic and melodramatic soundtrack for singing grifters, murderous marionettes, and grease-painted gutterballs. It's an oom-pah wedding, squealing and lyrical, that hits like punk rockers and sings like a gypsy camp. Guignol played its first shows backing up the fire-breathing, maggot-eating Lucky Devil Circus Sideshow from Coney Island every weekend at CBGBs; and has since operened for acts as varied as Annie Anxiety and Tulip Sweet at the Terrorsex Cabaret night at Luxx, anarcho-punx Against Me! (Fat Wreck Chords) at SUNY Purchase, and Gutbucket, Barbez, and Sleepytime Gorilla Museum at Northsix. A band energetic enough for the punks and subtle for the jazz brunchers. Guignol is Franz Nicolay (accordion) and Peter Hess (clarinet) of Anti-Social Music and the World/Inferno Friendship Society, with George Rush (tuba, Raymond Scott Orchestrette) and special guest Paul Chuffo of Gutbucket on drums, one night only, get him while he's hot.

<p>"Guignol, featuring members of World/Inferno and the Raymond Scott Orchestrette, performs eerie accordian pieces with art-house stylings." - CitySearch</p>

ABOUT "21st Century Schizoid Music"<br/>
"21st Century Schizoid Music" is an ongoing series curated by Frank Oteri, editor of the award-winning monthly magazine www.newmusicbox.org <http://www.newmusicbox.org>. It is an exploration of music by New York-based composers who write contemporary concert works and also play in eclectic downtown bands.  Each concert, an hour-long set beginning at 9:00 P.M., will present both halves of the composers' split identities. "In the world we now live in, multi-tasking is the norm," comments Oteri.  "So it's totally natural that so many composers and musicians nowadays not only maintain day jobs that have nothing to do with their music, but maintain several different musical personae which often have nothing to do with each other.  It is in that spirit that we present 21st Century Schizoid Music as part of the Cornelia Street Caf&eacute;'s new One Drink Minimum Series on Monday nights.  If there are connections between the various strands of music we are each making, they are for the audience to decide!" Past concerts have featured Kitty Brazelton, Derek Bermel, Steven Swartz, and Oteri himself.
