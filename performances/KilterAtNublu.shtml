PIONEERING JAZZ/METAL TRIO “KILTER” JOIN FORCES WITH DIVERSE COLLEAGUES IN A CONVERGENCE OF ESTABLISHED WORK AND A NEW, IN-PROCESS EPIC PROJECT
</p>


<p>Now that we have your attention:<br/><br/>
ASM presents the progressive/post metal trio Kilter, appearing at Nublu 151, the jazz and new music venue in New York’s Lower East Side, on March 31st. They will be joined by seven)suns, a string quartet spanning realms of Metal, Classical, and Ambient genres, and by Andromeda Anarchia, the soprano likewise known for genre-bending between extreme and traditional categories. There will be opportunities for each of the artists/groups to perform music from their respective catalogues, but the focus of the evening is something entirely new: the first public performances of music from a forthcoming opera, <span class="worktitle">La Suspendida</span>, being composed by Kilter for these and additional collaborators.</p>

<p>“We were struck by a disturbing episode from history,” explains Kenny Grohowski, drummer of Kilter: “A young woman died in the care of the doctor who was obsessed with her &ndash; and he kept her corpse as his lover for many years.” “We weren’t interested in the obvious weirdness of the story,” Ed Rosenberg III, Kilter saxophonist, adds. “We became interested in the woman’s journey &ndash; not as a victim but as a human with an extremely extended ‘moment’, so to speak, between life and death.” The libretto, created from extended conversations with the musicians, is by author, Metropolitan Opera commentator, and devoted Metalhead William Berger. Kilter bassist Laurent David observes: “The drama is simultaneously unique and universal &ndash; we are aiming to provide music about which the same will be said.”</p>
