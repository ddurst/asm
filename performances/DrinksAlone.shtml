<h3>Anti-Social Music... Drinks Alone</h3>

"You know, I like Anti-Social Music, and all, but... it's just that, well, sometimes it's just too much, too overwhelming.  And it's not them - it's me.  There is just so much out there that I don't know - and so much about ASM that is - I don't know - like they're always keeping me at a distance.  I know that they love me, but there are so many of them.  When there's like, the guy with the mohawk sawing away at his cello, and the funny-looking chick with glasses thinkin' she's Dizzy Gillespie or something with her cheeks all puffed out (I mean, really...), the spazz jumping around squealing on the clarinet, the wheezing accordion, and the Asian dude with the Mets cap (I mean, really...).... you know, it's just too much. I can't take it all in, it's too loud, too much going on, too much eye candy. If they would just go one at a time I feel like I might be able to understand them - to <em>be</em> with them... You know, take turns or something? Like, don't all jump in the sandbox at once, man. I need my space, dude."
