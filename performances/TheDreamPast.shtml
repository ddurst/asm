It has been said that the ability to talk to ghosts is directly proportional to the amount of historical material that has been electronically archived. In the current day, the internet overflows with secret material, creating unimaginable opportunities to touch the past. The live davening (recitation of Jewish liturgical prayers) archive, previously held in secret collections and circulated on dubbed cassettes by a tiny community of fans, has begun to go public via file sharing sites and streaming video. These recordings provide raw access to the long-form improvisatory style of prayer leading in the khazones tradition (sacred Jewish improvisational cantors), light-years removed from the stylized excerpts heard on old gramophone records. This newly accessible material has proven especially valuable to contemporary cantorial revivalists, for whom these recordings may provide their only exposure to khazones as a ritual performance form.

ASM is thrilled to present, with Congregation Beth Elohim, the premiere performance of <span class="worktitle">The Dream Past: A Sonic Conjuring</span> by Brooklyn’s <a href="https://jeremiahlockwood.com/music/sway-machinery/" target="_blank">The Sway Machinery</a> (a group <i>The New Yorker</i> called “unclassifiable and uplifting”) at an art deco synagogue. Not kidding. Read on.

Featuring the double-front of vocalists Yuli Ya’el Be’eri and band-leader Jeremiah Lockwood, the ace horn section of band-cofounders Stuart Bogie and Jordan McLean, and the great beauty of drummer John Bollinger, The Dream Past extends the band’s long running project of cantorial revival &ndash; excavating the otherworldly potentials of Jewish sacred music and lost melodies to instigate a party, break boundaries between communities, and touch the past. Like its debut project, <span class="worktitle">Hidden Melodies Revealed</span>, which also drew upon High Holidays liturgy, <span class="worktitle">The Dream Past</span> offers an expansive vision of what can be achieved through commitment to ancestor voices and reciprocity with the dead. This new work turns to a lost&mdash;and now rediscovered&mdash;archive of bootleg recordings of live prayer leading as the source material for its ecstatic transformation.
