<p>
There's been a lot of talk about what the moon is. Not A moon, but THE moon.
</p>

<p>
Is it hollow? Is it inhabited? Is it artificial? We may never know. In fact, we may never care. By the time these details matter, the Earth will be uninhabitable for humans, and everything you have ever known &ndash; indeed, every bit of history, every record of every work of art, every person who has ever lived (as far as we know) &ndash; will be gone. Erased from the face of the planet, straight out of a Neal Stephenson novel (ok, technically some survived on and outside the planet, but that's a different subject). There will be no Shakespeare, no Jesus, no Mozart, no Galileo, no Einstein, no one. All gone. Lost to the ravages of the surface of our planet should something catastrophic happen with the moon.
</p>

<p>However. You can still enjoy Moons, right now, right here on planet Earth (while it's here).</p>

<p>
MOONS is a collective featuring four composers:<br/><br/>
Katie Porter (clarinet)<br/>
Chistine Tavolacci (flutes)<br/>
Laura Cetilia (cello)<br/>
Judith Berkson (vocals and accordion)
</p>

<p>
And this is a performance celebrating their album release, featuring new compositions, one by each member of MOONS:<br/>
