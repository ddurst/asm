<p><i>THOMAS BERNHARD, ACCORDION PLAYER<br/><br/>
The last time my grandfather came to New York, Pat, he warned me, Pat, said I had to give up playing the accordion when he died, I couldn't continue down this path, now here I am, I don't intend to play a day after this concert, Pat, I'm here in a place I never thought I'd return to, to which I never wanted to return, but I don't understand what you're doing here, Pat, this is something I wanted to ask you, this worried me the most, how could someone who doesn't have to write for accordion, someone who is free to write for any instrument they choose, Pat, prefer to speak through this abomination, this wretched squeezebox, explain it to me, Pat, a truly vomitous instrument with which only truly sinister composers can work, which is why I can't explain why you're here, it's the most repulsive thing, it's truly absurd if you're interested in writing serious music, this demonstrates that really you're not interested in writing serious music, Pat, no-one interested in writing serious music could opt for an instrument as degenerate as thing, on which no-one plays serious music, where the few who could play, don't play, this is the truth, this is the horrible truth, Pat, and still the cluelessness of the world to call this an "instrument," what nonsense, it's an idiocy that would be funny if it weren't grotesque, but still I'm glad you've come.</i></p>
