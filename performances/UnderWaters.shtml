<h3>Waters<br/>ASM</h3>

			<div id="details">

<p>
	We're continuing our on-again/off-again relationship with the talented and renowned Charles Waters. We're splitting the difference again, with him under our baton and us under his.
</p>

<p>
	It's the first of THREE shows in June, so we're kind of drowning in new music. Not a show is to be missed, but this one especially. We'll be at <a href="" target="stone">The Stone</a> in Manhattan as part of Charles Waters' residency, playing a new piece by the itinerant and transient Peter Hess, an encore by the transliterating and erudite Pat Muchmore, and a world premiere by Charles Waters, whom I don't really know all that well, to be honest (but he may or may not have been recently knighted).
