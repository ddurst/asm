Yes, it's short notice.  And yes, it's in Jersey.  And yes, you're not
supposed to begin a sentence with a conjunction.  But we know that you
would want to know that Anti-Social Music is taking a starring
role tomorrow (Sunday) night at the <a href="http://hamiltonst.homestead.com/index.html">Hamilton St. Cafe</a> in Bound Brook, New Jersey.
</p>

<p>The evening begins at about 6 PM and has an $8 cover--which is a heck of a deal since you'll be seeing the likes of Static Radio, The Cosmic Brotherhood of Ra, and Drawn in the Sky.  All this as the opening act to the one-and-only ASM.  We'll be going on at around 9 o'clock or so, but it would be a shame to miss the rest of the night, especially since you're going all the way out to Jersey in the first place. (Please disregard this last point if you're already in Jersey)</p>

<p>So, come one, come all.  It's not like you have anything better to do, and we'll be playing all of your favorite hits.  We'll be doing some string quartet stuff, some electronic stuff, maybe some duets.  OK, so we don't exactly know what pieces we'll be playing, but I'm sure they're your favorites nonetheless.</p>
