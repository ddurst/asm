<h3>ASM Back in Back</h3>
			</div>

			<div id="details">

<p>You're probably expecting some Yankovician play on AC/DC's "Back In Black" lyrics, and at this point you're likely realizing that's not going to happen. You're disappointed. That's fair. We can't always rise to the challenge of a master parodist, but we can turn a concert into an experience.</p>

<p>You read that right. I'm upping the ante. I'm saying: antiphonal.</p>

<p>While the program is a mix of world premieres and other repertoire, we're doing something new for you &ndash; the audience. We're putting you on the stage.</p>

<p>Or, rather, we're putting the stage around you. This performance seeks to use the space as a performer. All of these pieces exploit the physical space to immerse the listener in real-life surround sound live performance. Goodbye, fancy hipster loft parties. Goodbye, austere "us and them" seating arrangements. We will be all over the place; here, there, and everywhere; right behind you, and way over there; binaural. Get it? Got it? Good.</p>

<p>You will stand in the presence of the sound waves of:<br/><br/>
Rima FAND - <span class="worktitle">Serpent Tango</span> for string quartet<br/><br/>
Al GIUSTO - <span class="worktitle">Suite No. 1</span> for string trio and trumpet<br/><br/>
Peter HESS - <span class="worktitle">Salt or Hail</span> for two clarinets<br/><br/>
Pat MUCHMORE - <span class="worktitle">String Quartet No. 3 "Antiphonal"</span>world premiere for string quartet<br/><br/>
Kamala SANKARAM - <span class="worktitle">60 Words</span> for string quartet<br/><br/>
Charles WATERS - <span class="worktitle">Father Popieluszko Square</span> for two clarinets and strings
</p>

<p>You will stand in the presence of the talents of:<br/><br/>
	Tim Byrnes, Hubert Chen, Claudia Chopek, Jean Cook, Peter Hess, Judith Insell, Pat Muchmore, and Charlie Waters.
</p>
