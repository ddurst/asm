			</div>

<p>
Anti-Social Music is old y’all. Seriously: the group itself is now almost old enough to legally drink in America, and we’re already feverishly developing a formula to calculate what this means for each of our personal consumption. The results thus far are encouragingly frightening. We’re so old that the “anti-social” part of our name&mdash;which used to refer to the anti-social qualities of our music&mdash;now applies to us too. More often than not these days, we just want to be alone.
</p>

<p>
And that would be a great reason for the solo show extravaganza we’re doing at Scholes Street Studio this February the 23rd, if it weren’t for the fact that we’ve being doing these evenings featuring new music for solo performers for more than a decade now. We’re calling it “Anti-Social Music Drinks Alone, Alone Again, Again,” and it’ll be two hoots and three quarters. Featuring a motley cr&Uuml;e of composers and performers such as Jen Baker, Roberta Michel, Ty Citerman, Will Holshouser, Brad Kemp, Pat Muchmore and Barry Seroff. We’ve got pieces for harmonica and accordion, and we might even bring along a few instruments that aren’t free-reed.
</p>

<p>
Unlike the reeds, the show ain’t free, but at $9.99 it might as well be.

Which is basically to say - your tax dollars at work. Yeah. Frightening, isn't it?</p>
