<p>
I see no reason to not be absolutely upfront with you, gentle reader: there was really no consensus on the title for this show.
</p>

<p>
As such, to not hijack or otherwise supplant the will of the collective with my own, consider it my editorial duty to inform you of the various titles that this show COULD have sported:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>ASM Make Saxytime</li>
	<li>ASM Does The Sax</li>
	<li>ASM Avoids Sax Puns</li>
	<li>Sax Is Fine Between Consenting Adults</li>
	<li>ASM Is Sax Positive</li>
	<li>There's No Shame In Sax</li>
	<li>New York's Alright If You Like Saxophones</li>
	<li>Saxophone Sucks</li>
	<li>ASM Saxophones It In</li>
	<li>ASM Has Phone Sax</li>
	<li>ASM to perform lost Blood, Sugar, Sax, Magic album</li>
	<li>ASM suggests "Let's Talk About Sax, Baby" to local critic</li>
	<li>ASM gives and receives: An evening of Sax Nocturnes</li>
	<li>Respectable avante garde piece for "six '0' phones" goes horribly wrong</li>
	<li>This Just In: ASM claims sax puns "Not getting old"</li>
</ul>

<p>
Sadly, only one of these gems could make the cut, and so due to nothing more than a lack of organization and our neglecting to take votes when we did have a meeting, a save-the-date email that was recently sent has forced us to go with ASM Does Not Get Saxy. Because, you know, consistency.
</p>

<p>
But since you're here, why not keep going?
</p>

<ul>
	<li>ASM Is So Saxy It Hurts</li>
	<li>Saxomophones, Saxomophones...</li>
	<li>A Concert Only Lisa Simpson Could Love</li>
	<li>Casual Sax (Concert)</li>
	<li>Quartet? That's Disgusting.</li>
	<li>We Actually Meant "Sexphones" But Google Corrected Us</li>
	<li>ASM Presents A Night Of Impressive Fingers And Tongues</li>
	<li>ASM Brings Saxy Back</li>
	<li>Sweet J*sus, Guys, My Mom Might See This</li>
	<li>ASM Keeps It Clean (For Your Mom)</li>
</ul>


<p>
But, alas, in the end, we are not saxy.
<br/><br/>
In the title. In the music, it's all about the saxy.
