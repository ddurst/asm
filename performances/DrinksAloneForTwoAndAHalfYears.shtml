Look, we’ve done ten shows in this series. We’ve emphasized our evolution, our prepubescence, 2017 taking one on the chin, the classical roots of solo drinking, sensory overload of society, living your life, personal vices as social bonds, and private shame as public fa&ccedil;ade. We’ve been doing solo and distanced shows since before it was cool, in the pre-mandate years. H1N1 wasn’t a thing. iPads didn’t exist. We didn’t yet know that our idols were (are?) quite possibly terrible human beings. The United States still had an unbroken streak of only old white dudes as president.
</p>

<p>
Much has changed since then, but one thing remains consistent: we still drink alone. Maybe more than we used to. Maybe for good reason. Or maybe just the lens of time has grown more opaque. In short: we’ve been drinking alone for at least two and a half years, and we have no plans to stop now. So we’re going to make the most of it and so should you. Come drink alone with us and enjoy some musicians drinking, accompanied by solo instruments, in relative public.
</p>

<p>Maybe it will become a tradition.</p>
