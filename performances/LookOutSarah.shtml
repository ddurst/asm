<h3>Look Out, Sarah Lawrence</h3>

			</div>
	
			<div id="details">

<p>
On Wednesday, September the 28th at 8 PM in Reisinger Concert Hall, Anti-Social Music and a friend or two will play several compositions by Dr. Patrick Thomas Thomas More Muchmore: SLC music theory and composition teacher extraordinaire. There will be pieces for cello, violin, piano, trombone, clarinet, electronics, alto saxophone, clarinet and bari saxophone &ndash; all played by only four individuals.
</p>

<p>
It's sure to be fun for the audience, young and old alike, and deeply nerve-wracking and fraught with potential embarrassment for the composer.
</p>

<p>
And don't forget to invite your friends!
</p>
