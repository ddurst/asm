<b>Kinesis Project dance theatre</b>, <b>Opera on Tap</b>, <b>Anti-Social Music</b>, <b>Summer on the Hudson</b>, and <b>Shahrokh Yadegari</b> presents pop-up performances of <span class="worktitle">Capacity, or: the Work of Crackling</span> on September 30 and October 1, 2023 at 5-6:00PM, beginning at Locomotive Lawn in Riverside Park South at West 62nd Street, NYC.
</p>

<p>
This immersive experience is a brand-new multi-disciplinary work developed through collaborations of music, sound and visual components. <span class="worktitle">Capacity, or: the Work of Crackling</span> is Kinesis Project’s most recent collaboration with Opera on Tap investigating our human capacity for joy, grief and how that relates to the natural processes of the earth’s cracking.
</p>

<p>
<span class="worktitle">Capacity, or: the Work of Crackling</span> is an expansive, yet intimate theatrical experience that draws and guides audiences along the bridges and landscapes of Riverside Park South. The performances feature costumes by designer Rebecca Kanach, sound design by Shahrokh Yadegari and music by Anti-Social music composers Diana Woolner, David Friend, Eyal Moaz and Brian McCorkle.
</p>

<p>
Kinesis Project’s Choreographer and Artistic Director Melissa Riker has been working with the collaborative guidance of geologist Dr. Missy Eppes, exploring the parallels found in mechanical weathering and subcritical cracking.
</p>

<p>
“After many months of learning about how our human capacity and resilience parallels the earth’s geological behaviors - I am thrilled to be bringing <span class="worktitle">Capacity, or: the Work of Crackling</span> to life with the incredible dancers of Kinesis Project and our talented colleagues in Opera on Tap and Anti Social Music,” said Melissa Riker. “We are so grateful to Riverside Park and Summer on the Hudson for being a creative home for our exploration of this work!”
</p>

<p>
Beginning with cracking, edges, resilience and human capacity, Riker and Opera on Tap thread their collaborative vision, inviting the skills of Anti-Social Music composers to build the voice of the work. Now, this bold and inspiring performance offers a calm and full exploration of edges, NYC’s natural landscapes and the intimacy of our humanity.
</p>

<p>
“We are so excited to be working again with our friends at Kinesis Project and at Anti-Social Music to bring this innovative and community-driven piece to one of New York City’s great parks this Fall,” said Anne Hiatt, Artistic and Executive Director, Opera on Tap. “At its core, this project invites audiences to explore the human capacity for grief and resilience in context of the greater, overwhelming and ever-shifting world that surrounds us. To me, this project invites healing and reflection at a time when we all individually and collectively need it. Without question, it is a piece for our time, and one that I am very proud to be a part of.”
</p>

<p>
<span class="worktitle">Capacity, or: the Work of Crackling</span> will be danced by Kinesis Project dancer/collaborators Bree Breedon, Hilary Brown, Sabrina Canas and Madeline Hoak, with four live instrumentalists and four singers.
</p>

Robinson, New York State Council on the Arts, The Howard Gilman Foundation through The Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone and the individual donors of Opera on Tap and Kinesis Project dance theatre.
