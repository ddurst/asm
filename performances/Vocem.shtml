	Just as Robert Plant was to Led Zeppelin, as Stevie Nicks was to Fleetwood Mac, as David Lee Roth was to Van Halen, and as Freddie Mercury was to Queen, so too is NY's own Anti-Social Music channeling the power of the human voice in its next all-premieres show, June 21st at the National Opera Center in Manhattan.
</p>

<p>
	But we're going one step further than those sad little aforementioned "music bands," we're backing all the vocalists with SHEER. CHAMBER. MUSICIAN. MAGIC. That's right, no boring ol' guitar, bass, and drums here &ndash; no siree ma'am &ndash; we're talking piano and cello. Piano and flute! Contra bass, two cellos, and viola! Flute, clarinet, trumpet, guitar, piano, violin, two violas, two cellos, and bass. We could go on, but you get the picture.
</p>

<p>
	This performance of never-before-heard music comes to you from <b>Max Duykers</b>, <b>Rima Fand</b>, <b>Al Giusto</b>, <b>Dan Lasaga</b>, <b>David Mallamud</b>, <b>Pat Muchmore</b>, <b>Barry Seroff</b>, and <b>Jeff Hudgins</b> by way of Anti-Social Music. It will pull on your soulstrings like nothing but God has before. You won't believe your ears. God won't believe his ears. Her ears. Whatever.
</p>

<p>
	Come bear witness to the performing talents of Hubert Chen, Ty Citerman, Jeanann Dara, Loren Dempster, Rima Fand, Jeff Hudgins, Brad Kemp, Patti Kilroy, Pat Muchmore, Kamala Sankaram, Barry Seroff, Aaron Shugge, Greg Squared, George Wright and more! Only then will this sentence make any sense: Join us as we find <span class="worktitle">The Way In</span> from the <span class="worktitle">Winter Seed</span>, <span class="worktitle">Oh Lord!</span> Shake off this <span class="worktitle">Flyte of Indecision</span> from <span class="worktitle">Sneaky and the Bullfighter.</span> Vanquish <span class="worktitle">HyperBABEL</span> with <span class="worktitle">Atheist Hymns</span> and a <span class="worktitle">Mannequin Heart</span>.
