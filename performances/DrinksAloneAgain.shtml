<h3>Anti-Social Music <br/>Drinks Alone...<br/>Again.</h3>

			</div>
	
			<div id="details">

<p>People often ask us: ASM, why do you drink alone?</p>

<p>We aren't embarrassed about it. It's OK. We've grown. We've moved on. We no longer compulsively check for email, hoping to discover messages from long-lost friends. No, we are going to be fine. We sort through our mail, like anyone else, and pay the bills, call our parents, maybe make a nice dinner. Maybe we'll take a bath and read a book. Maybe take a continuing education class, you know, to get back out there. We're good. Really. We just want to finish up this drink. You go on ahead. No, really, this is the last one.</p>

<p>It is entirely possible that you will, in this performance, hear/witness world premiere solo works by/for:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Gordon Beeferman, <span class="worktitle">Burnt Sienna</span> (NY premiere) for for bari saxophone played by Josh Sinton</li>
	<li>Melissa Dunphy, <span class="worktitle"> Theme and Variables: Scallops and Bollocks for Tea (an ode to CSIRAC)</span> (world premiere) for violin and tape played by Curtis Stewart</li>
	<li>Max Duykers, <span class="worktitle">Title TBA</span> (world premiere) for violin played by Curtis Stewart</li>
	<li>Jeff Hudgins, <span class="worktitle">It's 5:00 Everywhere for alto &amp; baritone saxophones (2 short mvts)</span> (world premiere) played by the composer</li>
	<li>Pat Muchmore, <span class="worktitle">Title TBA</span> (world premiere) for cello played by the composer</li>
	<li>Ed RosenBerg, <span class="worktitle">horse-morsel from beyond</span> (world premiere) for baritone saxophone played by Jeff Hudgins</li>

	<li>Alla Zagaykevych, <span class="worktitle">Luceo</span> (NY premiere) for piano played by Jonathan Vincent</li>
</ul>

<p>That's right: some of these pieces are so new, THEY'RE STILL BEING WRITTEN.</p>

<p>Though it is conceivable that one or two of these jokers will be too ashamed of their past to perform.</p>

<p>Weak.</p>

<p class="mediumprint">This program is supported, in part, by public funds from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs, in partnership with the City Council, and in part with public funds from the New York State Council on the Arts, a state agency. Which is basically to say - your tax dollars at work. Yeah, frightening isn't it?</p>
