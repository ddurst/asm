<p>
	Today's society is a sensory onslaught, from the city lights that keep you awake at night to the sounds of headphones attempting to drown out the subway announcements. The world has become a boombox on everyone's shoulder.
	<br/><br/>
	At the end of the bar, there's less noise. We go there to find the silence that evaporates in the instant when you open your eyes. Out with the people, but safely isolated, we can find solace in each glass. Solace after solace after solace.
	<br/><br/>
	It's never enough, is it? 1 begets 2 begets 3 and so on. You feel it too. Sitting in the cheap seats, listening to the band, the DJ, the orchestra... you hear the same tidal wave of data that drowns you, day after day. Holding your hair just to thrust you under again, as you cough and wheeze a breath just in time. That's entertainment.
	<br/><br/>
	And that's why you need that same solace. And that's why you drink.
</p>

<p>
	No! Sorry! That's not why you drink at all! You drink for the same reason we do: you're just thirsty.
	<br/><br/>
	We're not alone at the end of the bar crying into our glass, we're making it easy on the bartender &mdash; creating that express lane from his hand to ours, with no speedbumps in between. There's nothing wrong with staking out your barstool and making a go of it for the evening. Heck, you can even keep the barstool. We welcome this approach to imbibing, and we welcome it with music. There is no shame in drinking alone, because it's not therapy, it's just a drink! Big deal! Bartender! Another, please!
</p>

<p>
	But there is no bartender. And there is no bar.<br/><br/>
	Dammit, we haven't even left the apartment.
