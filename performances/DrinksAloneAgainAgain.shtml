<h3>ASM Drinks Alone again... again</h3>
			</div>
	
			<div id="details">

<p>
	We're not ashamed to say it: sometimes we get a little lonely. We're also not ashamed to say that we occasionally imbibe. And so, OK, we'll even admit—with only a soup&ccedil;on of embarrasment—that we sometimes imbibe a lot. Like, buckets.
</p>

<p>
	With a little more than a twinge of guilt, we'll go so far as to confess that the loneliness is actually rather frequent, deep, and abiding. We compensate mostly with three of our favorite vices: dissonance, genre-smashing, and compositions for unaccompanied solo instruments. However, we'd be lying if we said liquor didn't have a role to play as an additional compensating vice. Put two and two together, and yes, we spend an inordinate amount of our time playing alone, and drinking alone.
</p>

<p>
	But we've found a solution! Instead of playing and drinking alone, while being completely alone, why don't we play and drink alone, WITH YOU? It's perfect! So join us at Ibeam Brooklyn on Friday, May 8th at 8:30 PM for our extravaganza of (mostly) new music written for solo instruments. We'll have tunes by Patrick Castillo, Max Duykers, Pat Muchmore, Ed RosenBerg, Jeff Hudgins, Andrea La Rose, and more. Performers include Ed RosenBerg, Andie Springer, Curtis Stewart, and others. And, because our fifth-favorite vice is deepening levels of irony, we'll be sharing our Drinks Alone bill with Nathan Koci and Emily Hope Price's group Scorpion vs Snake.

	<i>About Scorpion vs Snake:</i><br/>
Nathan Koci plays the accordion and also brass instruments and sometimes composes music for theater, dance, and film. He plays around NYC and elsewhere with various new music, classical music, jazz music, folk music, and theater music type folks. Emily Hope Price sings and plays the cello and is also a songwriter, arranger, and film composer and can also be seen/heard performing in a band called Pearl and the Beard. She likes to draw and watch movies at the same time and talk about surviving an impending zombie apocalypse until something else comes along even more interesting to talk about.
</p>

<p class="smallprint">This program is supported, in part, by public funds from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs, in partnership with the City Council, and in part with public funds from the New York State Council on the Arts, a state agency. Which is basically to say - your tax dollars at work. Yeah, frightening isn't it?</p>
