<p>Anyway, here it is, chamber music for the artistically peripatetic and morally suspect. Out of the sweaty confines of Greenwich House, free from the unblinking eye of the maintenance guy at CAMI Hall, into comfortably louche quarters off the Square. As always, a mere $9.99. Now cheaper than the movies!</p>

<p>Sure, we don't have stadium seating, but can you get hard liquor and Ambience-with-a-capital "A" at the AMC 21? Can you get music that would normally accompany an autistic dwarf's nightmares at AMC 21? (Wow, can you get more tasteless?) Can you get a drunk and ranting Oklahoman at AMC 21? Actually, you know the answer is yes, which reminds me, don't miss the afterparty at a sleazy T.S. bar to be named later. Plus: Art by Miss Lasko-Gross, who's got a comic book called AIM, and has been featured in Screw magazine and the New Museum of Contemporary Art.</p>

<p>

<b>Directions:</b><br/>
Once you are at Times Square, make sure you're on 42 St. and get to the northwest corner of 42nd and 8th Ave. (You'll be standing pretty much in front of a gigantic Duane Reade) The next building west of the drug store, labelled in a pretty cursive sign as Three Hundred Three Towers, is the one. Go through the right-most set of doors and head up the elevator to the 2nd floor. Exit the elevator and walk to your right down a long and cramped hallway. When you get to the podium, pay the nice man or woman $9.99 and walk through the doorway to your right. Welcome to the lobby! There should be a few steps immediately to your left as you enter the lobby--go up them and through the door on your right. This is the theatre where we will be perpetrating our unique brand of perversion on your ears, so find a seat and prepare yourself.
