				<h3>Martha Cluver</h3>
				<h4>Soprano</h4>

				<p>Martha Cluver lives in NYC with her husband Caleb Burhans.  Martha sings soprano with a number of professional choirs in the city and surrounding area, including the Trinity Wall Street choir in NYC.  A recent graduate, Martha earned her BM in viola performance from the Eastman School of Music in 2003 where she studied with John Graham.  Martha also became involved with the new music group which formed at Eastman, called Alarm Will Sound, directed by Alan Pierson, and occasionally performs with them.  AWS has recorded works by Steve Reich in which Martha has sang and played, including The Desert Music, Music for Large Ensemble and Viola Phase, to name a few.  Martha was also involved with the US premiere of Michael Gordon's Decasia for film and amplified instruments, performed in September 2004 by Manhattan School of Music's new music group called Tactus directed by Patti Monson.  In 2005, Martha will perform the world premiere of John Zorn's Frammenti del Sappho for 5 female singers a cappella and Babbit's An Elizabethan Sextette for women's voices in 6 parts a cappella.  Good stuff.</p>
