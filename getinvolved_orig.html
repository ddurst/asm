			<h3>If you would like to donate to or volunteer for ASM, let us know. Contact <a href="mailto:antisocialmusic@gmail.com">antisocialmusic@gmail.com</a>.</h3>
			<p>Of course, an excellent way to get involved is to come and see us whenever we perform.  <a href="mailto:antisocialmusic@gmail.com">E-mail us</a> to get on our mailing list.</p>

			<p>Yet another way--we invite <b>questioning</b> composers to submit scores for consideration for concerts in the New York area.</p>
			<p>Are you <b>Questioning</b>?</p>
			<p>Do you have a hard time deciding what genre you belong to? We feel ya. So far, we identify as punk/classical, but lately we've been dabbling in hip-hop/minimalist/thrash/electric tuba-ism, latin-mass/ritual drumming/rock organ orgies, trance/fiddlin'/sweet vocalise, and god-knows what have you. It's so difficult dealing with the labels society tries to slap on folks these days that we're experiencing severe social, emotional and cognitive isolation, resulting in a higher incidence of mental health issues including bouts of depression, lower self esteem, problems with anxiety as well as complex, unstable family situations due in part to issues of coming out, silence and secrecy. Whew!</p>
			<p>But we're determined to do something about it, damn it! And that's why we're reaching out to you, the genre-disaffected masses. Here's the deal:</p>
		</div>

		<div id="section3">
			<p>Write a genre-fukked piece for us, your Anti-Social Music pals. If we dig it, we'll play it. Several times, even. Pretty much anything goes as far as instrumentation is concerned, but keep the numbers down to less than 10 folks (no orchestra pipe-dreams, people, it's just not our thing), and the timing to less than 20 minutes. Oh, and it's gotta gotta gotta be a world-premiere. Got it?</p>
			<p>Because we need to feel comfortable sharing our genre-conflicted feelings with you, we'll need a bit more information and materials from you.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>One or two recordings (no DATs) of previous stuff you've done. Scores would be nice too, if you got 'em.</li>
				<li>Tell us the last good book, article, porn mag, etc. you read.</li>
				<li>One of the following: a haiku about why you compose, a drawing or picture about why you compose, a short mix tape/CD of your influences, or a brief letter of recommendation from a non-musical family member or friend that talks about your non-composing interests and strengths as a person.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>If you're feeling particularly sassy and are looking to challenge your genre-fukked ways, we have a pre-set instrumentation you can write for, called 11tet: wind I (a sax/sop sax/cl), wind II (a sax/cl/fl), wind III (t sax/a sax/cl/fl), wind IV (b sax/a sax/cl), horn, trombone, tuba, vibes, set, violin, and cello. These folks are such good improvisers and readers, they'll bust your spleen. Do write spleen-busting music for this gang. Other rules above apply.</p>
			<p>Want your stuff back? Send a SASE.</p>
			<p>Want to know what you're getting into? http://antisocialmusic.org Streams of past performances are there.</p>
			<p>Mail your stuff to:</p>
			<p>please e-mail <a href="mailto:webmaster@antisocialmusic.org">webmaster@antisocialmusic.org</a> for physical address.</p>
			<p>Packages with only tapes and scores will be reviewed last and probably not while we're sober.</p>
			<p>If you're still Questioning, email us: <a href="mailto:antisocialmusic@gmail.com">antisocialmusic@gmail.com</a></p>
