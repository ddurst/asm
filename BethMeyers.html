				<h4>Violist</h4>

				<p>As an active violist in the field of contemporary music, Beth is committed to working with emerging composers and performing new works both as a soloist and chamber musician.  Founder of the contemporary flute/viola/harp trio, janus, she has contributed to broadening the trio repertoire with countless emerging composers (check out www.janustrio.org for upcoming projects!)  She has also worked with composers and artists including Martin Bresnik, Bill Irwin, Helmut Lachenmann, Meredith Monk and Steve Reich.  Beth collaborates with Anti-Social Music, The Theater of a Two-Headed Calf, Ensemble Pampelmousse, The Axis String Quartet, and Alarm Will Sound as a violist, vocalist and percussionist.</p>
				<p>Beth's study of improvisation has found her at venues such as The Knitting Factory working with artists including Ralph Alessi, Kokayi, and Mark Helias.  In 2000, she collaborated with jazz pianist and vocalist, Anna Johnson for her album One More Time In The Air (Oasis) and will be featured on Anna's latest album with Ben Whitman, Kaveh Rastegar and Mike McGuinnes. Beth is a graduate of the Eastman School of Music where, under the direction of George Taylor and John Graham, she received her Bachelor's and Master's degrees.</p>
